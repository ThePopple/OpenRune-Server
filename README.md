<p align="center">OpenRune Server is a modular fork of RSMod/Alter that powers an OSRS-compatible server with a plug-and-play plugin ecosystem focused on extensibility and ease of use.</p>

## 🤔 What is OpenRune Server?
OpenRune Server builds on the foundation laid by [RSMod](https://github.com/Tomm0017/rsmod) / [Alter](https://github.com/AlterRSPS/Alter)  to deliver a flexible, developer-friendly OSRS game server. Its modular architecture lets you ship new gameplay features as standalone plugins without touching core engine code. Server owners with little to no programming experience can rely on contributors to drop prebuilt plugins into the `content` module and have them load automatically at runtime.

## 🚀 Why Choose OpenRune Server?
### 🔧 Modular by design
OpenRune Server loads plugins dynamically, making it simple to extend gameplay, content, or systems while keeping the base server clean.

### 👥 Community-driven
Active maintainers review contributions, publish roadmap updates, and support users through Discord and Trello.

### 📏 OSRS-compatible
OpenRune Server adheres to OSRS protocols, giving you the freedom to connect any compliant client and customize server-side behavior.

## 🛠️ Getting Started



1. **Clone the repository**  
   - `File → New → Project from Version Control` in IntelliJ, then paste `https://github.com/OpenRune/OpenRune-Server.git`.
   - OpenRune Servernatively, clone via Git CLI and open the project manually.

2. **Install dependencies**  
   - Ensure you have [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).  
   - Set the project SDK to Java 17: `File → Project Structure → SDK`.
   - Recommended: install the [rscm-plugin](https://github.com/blurite/rscm-plugin) for better entity reference tooling.

3. **Gradle bootstrap**  
   - Open the Gradle tool window.  
   - Run `OpenRune Server → other → install`.  
   - When the task completes, run `OpenRune Server → game → Tasks → application → run`.

4. **Verify startup**  
   - A successful boot prints `OpenRune Server Successfully initialized` in the terminal.  
   - If you only see `OpenRune Server Loaded up in x ms.` you likely skipped a step.

Screenshots showcasing each step are available in the repo under `Resources/main/docs/resources/ReadMe_OpenRune Server/`.

## 🎮 Client Setup
> [!TIP]
> Use [RSProx](https://github.com/blurite/rsprox/releases) to connect; it is actively maintained by trusted developers and supports the required OSRS protocols.

For Windows:
1. Press `⊞ + R` and enter `%USERPROFILE%`.
2. Locate (or create) the `.rsprox` directory.
3. Create `proxy-targets.yaml` with:

```yaml
config:
  - id: 1
    name: OpenRune Server
    jav_config_url: https://client.blurite.io/jav_local_235.ws
    varp_count: 15000
    revision: 235.10
    modulus: YOUR_MODULUS_KEY_HERE
```

Find the modulus in the project root, copy it exactly, and replace `YOUR_MODULUS_KEY_HERE`. If `.rsprox` does not exist, launching RSProx once will create it.  

> [!WARNING]
> And stay away from client's like Devious, as they have been caught adding Account Stealer into their client.
